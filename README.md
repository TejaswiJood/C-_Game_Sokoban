The project encapsulates a unified gaming experience, seamlessly merging maze creation and gameplay functionalities. Users navigate through a dynamic interface that houses both a Control Panel and a Level Designer Form.

In the maze design phase, users employ the Level Designer Form to craft intricate levels. Walls, doors, and boxes can be intuitively placed, with the application validating inputs and offering a smooth saving process. The design interface also facilitates real-time adjustments and grid customization.

Transitioning to gameplay within the same project, users utilize the Play Form featuring a responsive game pad. The directional buttons empower players to maneuver selected boxes strategically. The application dynamically loads designed levels during gameplay, providing an uninterrupted experience. Scoring mechanisms, error handling, and a visually clear grid enhance overall playability.

In essence, this project offers a holistic gaming environment, seamlessly fusing level design and gameplay into a singular, user-friendly application.
